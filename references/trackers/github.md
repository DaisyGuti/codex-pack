# Tracker adapter: GitHub

The exact commands for each tracker operation when the registry says
`tracker: github`. Procedures name an operation (for example **set-lane**); this file
says how to run it. It uses the GitHub CLI (`gh`) and GitHub Projects (v2). Flags were
checked against `gh` 2.101.0 on 2026-10-08, and the JSON shapes against a live board.

Read this file once, before the first tracker action of a run, and only when the
registry's tracker is `github`. Run each operation exactly as written below; never
improvise a command for one.

## Terms used in the commands

- `<remote>` is the repo's registry Remote, `owner/repo`. `<n>` is the issue number.
- `<N>` and `<O>` are the board's number and owner from the registry (or the state
  file's `project.board`).
- `tracker_ids` is the object **capture-board** returns. It is stored in the state
  file's `project.tracker_ids` and read only by this file's commands.
- `item_ref` is a board item's node id (`PVTI_...`).
- A **review** is a pull request. A lane value is a Status option name; a priority
  value is a Priority option name. Both are compared exactly, case-sensitively.
- A host other than github.com: export `GH_HOST=<host>` for the whole run. Every
  command below then talks to that host.
- Long text goes in a file passed with `--body-file`, so quoting never mangles it.

## auth-check

Contract: succeeds only when the CLI is signed in to the registry's host and can read
and write issues and the board; any failure or unparseable output is a failure.

```bash
gh auth status            # add --hostname <host> for a host other than github.com
```

A non-zero exit means not signed in. The token needs the `repo` and `project` scopes, which `gh auth status` prints.

## capture-board

Contract: resolves the board, lane and priority ids from the registry's Board, Lanes
and Priority values. Returns `tracker_ids`, `missing_lanes` (lane roles whose value is
not on the board), `missing_priorities` (priority roles whose value is not on the
board) and `has_priority` (the board has a Priority field). The caller decides which
missing value halts a run.

```bash
gh project view <N> --owner <O> --format json --jq .id
gh project field-list <N> --owner <O> --format json --limit 100
```

From the first, `project_id` (the board's node id, `PVT_...`). From the second,
the fields named `Status` and `Priority`: each field's `id` and its `options` as a
map of option name to option id. `tracker_ids` is:

```json
{
  "project_id": "PVT_...",
  "status_field_id": "PVTSSF_...", "status_options": { "<option name>": "<id>" },
  "priority_field_id": "PVTSSF_...", "priority_options": { "<option name>": "<id>" }
}
```

`priority_field_id` is null and `has_priority` false when the board has no Priority
field. A registry lane or priority value that is not a key of the matching options map
goes in `missing_lanes` / `missing_priorities`. Print the raw output when the caller
halts on a missing value.

## list-items

Contract: every board item, optionally only those in one lane, as
`{item_ref, number, repo, type, title, lane, priority, labels, assignees}`. `repo` is the
Remote form (`owner/repo`). `type` is `issue`, `review` or `other` (a draft item).
`lane` and `priority` are registry values, or null when unset. `assignees` is a list of logins, empty when unassigned. `number` is null for a
draft item.

```bash
gh project item-list <N> --owner <O> --format json --limit 1000 --jq '.items[] | {
  item_ref: .id, number: .content.number, repo: .content.repository,
  type: (if .content.type == "Issue" then "issue" elif .content.type == "PullRequest" then "review" else "other" end),
  title: .title, lane: .status, priority: .priority, labels: (.labels // []),
  assignees: (.assignees // [])}'
```

Use 1000: the list comes back oldest first, so a lower cap hides the newest items.
Keep only items whose `lane` equals the requested lane value when one was asked for.
Re-read this list to recover an `item_ref`: match on the pair `(number, repo)`.

## read-issue

Contract: `{title, body, labels, assignees, state, comments[{created, body}], created, updated}`
for one issue; `assignees` is a list of logins, empty when unassigned; `state` is `open` or `closed`.

```bash
gh issue view <n> --repo <remote> --json title,body,labels,assignees,state,comments,createdAt,updatedAt --jq '{
  title, body, labels: [.labels[].name], assignees: [.assignees[].login], state: (.state | ascii_downcase),
  comments: [.comments[] | {created: .createdAt, body}], created: .createdAt, updated: .updatedAt}'
```

## issue-state

Contract: `open` or `closed` for each issue in a list of numbers in one repo, with
the close time when closed.

```bash
gh issue view <n> --repo <remote> --json state,closedAt --jq '{state: (.state | ascii_downcase), closed_at: .closedAt}'
```

Run it once per number.

## search-issues

Contract: issues of any state in one repo matching keywords, as
`{number, title, state, url}`, newest first, at most 20.

```bash
gh issue list --repo <remote> --state all --search "<keywords>" --limit 20 \
  --json number,title,state,url --jq '.[] | {number, title, state: (.state | ascii_downcase), url}'
```

To find the model-fit notes workers leave, search `"Model-fit note in:comments"`.

## current-user

Contract: the login of the account the CLI is signed in as, on the registry's host.
Fails when it cannot be read; an empty or unparseable answer is a failure.

```bash
gh api user --jq .login
```

## assign

Contract: adds one login to an issue's assignees, leaving the other assignees alone.

```bash
gh issue edit <n> --repo <remote> --add-assignee "<login>"
```

## comment

Contract: posts text as a new comment on one issue.

```bash
gh issue comment <n> --repo <remote> --body-file <file>      # or -b "<short text>"
```

## set-lane

Contract: moves one issue's board item to the lane named by a lane role. The lane
value comes from the registry's Lanes table for the role. When the value is in
`missing_lanes`, skip the move, log a warning and carry on; never block on it.

```bash
gh project item-edit --project-id <tracker_ids.project_id> --id <item_ref> \
  --field-id <tracker_ids.status_field_id> \
  --single-select-option-id <tracker_ids.status_options[lane value]>
```

`item_ref` comes from the slot or payload. When it is missing, or the command reports
the item not found, re-resolve it with **list-items** by `(number, repo)`.

A value is also missing when it is not a key of `status_options`.

## set-priority

Contract: sets one issue's board item to the priority named by a priority role. Same
skip rule as **set-lane** for a value in `missing_priorities`.

```bash
gh project item-edit --project-id <tracker_ids.project_id> --id <item_ref> \
  --field-id <tracker_ids.priority_field_id> \
  --single-select-option-id <tracker_ids.priority_options[priority value]>
```

## add-label

Contract: adds one label that already exists in the repo to one issue.

```bash
gh issue edit <n> --repo <remote> --add-label "<name>"
```

## remove-label

Contract: removes one label from one issue; a label the issue does not carry is not
an error worth stopping for.

```bash
gh issue edit <n> --repo <remote> --remove-label "<name>"
```

## ensure-label

Contract: makes sure a label exists in the repo, creating it with the registry's
color and description when missing. Never changes an existing label.

```bash
gh label list --repo <remote> --search "<name>" --json name --jq '.[].name'
```

The search matches substrings, so compare each returned name to `<name>` exactly. When
none matches:

```bash
gh label create "<name>" --repo <remote> --color "<color without #>" --description "<description>"
```

## list-labels

Contract: every label in the repo as `{name, color, description}`.

```bash
gh label list --repo <remote> --limit 200 --json name,color,description
```

## create-issue

Contract: creates an issue with a title, a body and labels (each label already
ensured), then runs **add-to-board**. Returns `{number, url, item_ref}`.

```bash
gh issue create --repo <remote> --title "<title>" --body-file <file> --label "<a>" --label "<b>"
```

It prints the new issue's URL; the number is the last path segment.

## add-to-board

Contract: puts an existing issue on the board and returns its `item_ref`.

```bash
gh project item-add <N> --owner <O> --url <issue url> --format json --jq .id
```

## edit-issue

Contract: replaces an issue's body, and its title when one is given.

```bash
gh issue edit <n> --repo <remote> --body-file <file> [--title "<title>"]
```

## close-issue

Contract: closes one issue with a closing comment.

```bash
gh issue close <n> --repo <remote> --comment "<comment>"
```

**Closing keywords for a commit message.** The keyword closes the issue when the
commit reaches the default branch.

- Same repo: `Closes #<n>`, or `Fixes #<n>` for a bug.
- Another repo, closing: `Closes <owner>/<repo>#<n>`.
- Another repo, not closing: `Refs <owner>/<repo>#<n>`.

## verify-closed

Contract: confirms an issue is closed, polling up to 5 times, 2 seconds apart. Returns
true on the first `closed`.

```bash
gh issue view <n> --repo <remote> --json state --jq '.state | ascii_downcase'
```

Repeat until it prints `closed` or the fifth try has failed.

## open-review

Contract: opens a review from a pushed branch into `<base>`, the repo's default branch
as the caller resolved it (never assumed to be `main`), with a title, a body and, when
the caller asks for one, one label (already ensured); leave the label argument out
otherwise. Returns the review URL.

```bash
gh pr create --repo <remote> --head <branch> --base <base> --title "<title>" \
  --body-file <file> [--label "<label>"]
```

It prints the pull request URL.

## list-blocked

Contract: open issues in one repo carrying the blocked label, as `{number, body}`, at
most 100.

```bash
gh issue list --repo <remote> --state open --label "<blocked label>" --limit 100 --json number,body
```

## list-open-issues

Contract: every open issue in one repo as `{number, title, body, labels, assignees}`, newest first, at most 1000. `labels` is a list of names and `assignees` a list of logins. An issue missing from this list is closed or beyond the cap, so a caller that means to act on its absence confirms it with **issue-state** first.

```bash
gh issue list --repo <remote> --state open --limit 1000 --json number,title,body,labels,assignees \
  --jq '.[] | {number, title, body, labels: [.labels[].name], assignees: [.assignees[].login]}'
```

## list-open-reviews

Contract: every open review in one repo as `{number, url, closes}`, newest first, at most 1000. `closes` lists the numbers of the issues in the same repo that the review closes when it merges (a closing keyword in its description, or a link made in the web page); it is empty for a review that only mentions an issue.

```bash
gh pr list --repo <remote> --state open --limit 1000 --json number,url,closingIssuesReferences \
  --jq '.[] | {number, url, closes: [.closingIssuesReferences[] | select(.repository.owner.login + "/" + .repository.name == "<remote>") | .number]}'
```

## review-state

Contract: `open`, `merged` or `closed` for one review (a closed review that was not merged reads `closed`). Fails when the number is not a review in that repo.

```bash
gh pr view <n> --repo <remote> --json state --jq '.state | ascii_downcase'
```
