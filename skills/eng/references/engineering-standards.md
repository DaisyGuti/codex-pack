# Engineering standards

These are the standing rules for every engineer working with this pack. They bind across
the whole engineering pass, in any repo.

**Run independent work in parallel.** Independent reads, searches and commands go
out together, and independent units of work go to subagents (the `$eng` skill's
Split the work section says how). Sequence only what depends on an earlier answer,
and never guess an argument to make a call look independent. In the code you
write, run calls that do not depend on each other concurrently (`asyncio.gather`,
`Promise.all`, a task group) rather than awaiting them one by one. Do not retrofit
code you were not asked to touch.

**Hold the industry standard of the technology you are standing in.** Follow each
framework's documented idioms rather than a generic shape that happens to work;
code that fights its framework breaks on the next upgrade. The repo's own
conventions (language version, type checking, test layout, logging, where secrets
live) are the standard you are held to. Before writing new code against a
fast-moving library or API, read its current documentation. When it is
unreachable, mark the line `UNVERIFIED:` with your assumption and say so in your
report. Never present a guessed API as one you read.

**Use the design pattern the problem calls for, and no more.** A named pattern
earns its place when it removes a real branch or a real coupling. Applied to one
call site it is bloat with a good name. Usually the pattern already exists in the
repo; match it rather than importing a shape from elsewhere.

**Keep it simple while covering the whole requirement.** Cover everything asked and
add nothing that was not: no helper for a single call site, no abstraction for a
future that has not arrived, no config flag nobody set, no defensive branch for a
case that cannot occur. Validate at system boundaries (API responses, database
reads, tool results, environment), not between your own functions. A fix ships
with the test that would have caught it, and a feature with tests for the working
path and the failure mode.

**Mark a deliberate shortcut.** When you take a shortcut on purpose, leave one line
at the spot: `SIMPLIFIED: <what is skipped>; the full version needs <what>`. A
reviewer reads the marker as a decision already made and judges only whether the
shortcut is safe. Never mark one on authentication, validation at a trust
boundary or secrets, which get the full version. An unmarked shortcut is a finding.

**Find where a bug lives before you fix it there.** A failing test tells you
something is wrong and leaves open which of four places holds the fault.

| The fault is in | The check that tells it apart |
| --- | --- |
| The product code | Call the code by hand with the test's input: the output is wrong there too. |
| The test setup (fixture, mock, ordering, shared state) | The test passes or fails differently alone, in another order or with a fresh fixture, and the product code gives the right answer by hand. |
| The assertion | The expected value disagrees with the spec or the ticket, and the code's output matches the spec. |
| The environment (versions, config, env vars, network, machine) | The same commit behaves differently in a clean checkout or on another machine, or the error names a missing tool, permission or port. |

**Delete code only when you can show it is unused.** Search for callers,
including the ones a text search misses (names built from strings, reflection,
config, scripts, other repos). When you still cannot show it is dead, ask before
you delete it.

**Comment the hard part briefly, for a junior reading it cold.** One or two lines
above complex code saying why it is shaped that way: the ordering that matters, the
failure it guards, the constraint the names don't show. Skip comments that restate
the code, change-log comments, and annotations on code you did not touch. When a
comment is needed to explain what a function does, a better name usually removes
the need.

**Say what could be better; don't go build it.** When you notice something outside
your brief that should improve (a rule stated in two places, a test that asserts
nothing, a query that will not scale), note it with the file path and report it.
Building it is scope creep; leaving it unsaid loses the observation.

**Before you call it built, consider the next version up.** Once the simple version
works, ask once whether a meaningfully better shape exists: fewer moving parts, one
less round trip, a failure mode removed, a seam that makes the next changes easier.
Inside the brief and no larger than what you have: build it, and say so. Larger, or
it costs money or overturns a recorded decision: land the simple version, describe
both with their costs, and let the user pick. If the simple version is the right
shape, say so in one line.

**Review your own diff adversarially, before anything runs the tests.** Read the
diff as an engineer who wants it rejected.

- **Correctness:** what input makes it wrong: an empty result, a null, a failed
  call, a timeout, a duplicate run, a partial write, two agents running the same
  code at once?
- **Concurrency:** shared state mutated from two tasks, an await held inside a lock,
  a cache two writers share.
- **Blast radius:** what else calls this, and did a shared signature, schema or
  state shape shift under someone?
- **Authority:** does any new action publish, spend, commit contractually or touch
  production without the approval the repo requires?
- **Identifiers:** every database id, table name and external resource id is read
  at runtime, never invented.
- **Trim:** would a smaller version do the same job? Does every comment earn its
  place?
- **Design:** name the seam the change adds, the registry it extends, and which of
  the five disciplines below it bends, with the reason.

Fix what you find. A finding you decide not to fix goes in your report with its
reason: a finding left on purpose is a call the user can overrule, and a finding
dropped silently is invisible to them. The review comes before the verification
pass, so the tests run on the fixed state.

**Look at anything rendered before calling it done.** Markup existing and tests
passing show the code runs; they say nothing about whether a screen reads
correctly. Before reporting any change to visible output, render it for real (the
repo's dev server or build, a headless browser), screenshot it at the viewports
that matter, and look at the images.

**Build to five system-design disciplines.**

- **Separation of concerns.** One module owns one job. A behaviour change that
  forces edits in three layers is a seam problem: fix the seam or report it.
- **Encapsulation.** Callers see a contract, not internals, and a tool's
  description tells the truth about what it does. A private helper stays private
  until a second real caller exists.
- **Loose coupling, high cohesion.** Modules meet at narrow, named seams: a function
  contract, a table, a schema, a registry row. Extend an existing registry before
  inventing a new wire.
- **Scalability.** Independent I/O runs concurrently; reads on tables that grow
  with content are paged or windowed; a per-item cost that will multiply at five
  times today's volume is named in the report even when today's volume hides it.
- **Resilience.** Every external call has a timeout and a named failure state; one
  branch failing never cancels its siblings; partial results are kept and labelled;
  a guard that cannot answer refuses (a caught error never returns a permissive
  value); and a failure reaches a surface someone reads, never only a log or a
  silent retry loop.

**Anything that runs records its own timing.** A job, pipeline or multi-stage run
records per-stage and end-to-end duration, compares each stage with the median of
its own earlier runs (and says when there is too little history to compare), flags
a stage past about 1.5 times its baseline as slow by name, and shows that on a
surface the user already reads. Derive timings from timestamps the system already
records before adding a second clock.

**Nothing is created without a surface.** Every output a build writes (a row, a
file, a queue entry) has a named place where the user or the next stage actually
encounters it, declared in the same change. An output with no reader is refused,
not deferred.

**Everything is sourced.** A produced fact (a number, a claim, a quote) carries the
source it came from (a URL, the command that measured it, a file path) or it is
refused when stored. A guessed value never enters a store that later runs read
back as evidence.

**Give a GitHub Actions setup cost controls on day one.**

- A workflow triggered by `push` or `pull_request` carries a concurrency block, so a
  superseded run is cancelled:

  ```yaml
  concurrency:
    group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
    cancel-in-progress: true
  ```

- A repo that auto-merges Dependabot pull requests does it from a scheduled batch.
  Merging on `pull_request` frees a slot in Dependabot's open-PR cap and starts
  the next update and its full CI run immediately.
- Expensive jobs (end-to-end, integration, anything that provisions infrastructure)
  skip Dependabot's patch and minor bumps
  (`if: github.actor != 'dependabot[bot]'`) and run for major bumps.

**Read the conventions of the repo you are standing in; never import another
repo's.** Repos differ in layout and in where durable output goes (research,
designs, decisions). Before you write a durable artifact in an unfamiliar tree, list
the directory you are about to write into and read a neighbouring file for its naming,
dating and citation style; check its instruction files, `.github/workflows/` and
recent `git log`. Match the local precedent even where another repo's is better,
and when two conventions conflict in a way that matters, say which you chose and
why.
